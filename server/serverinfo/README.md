# 🐱 튜토리얼

## Our Vision

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** a good vision statement shows the long-term goals of the company without getting too deep into strategy, implementation, or product specifics.
{% endhint %}

Our company vision is to **be the authoritative reference point for environmentally conscious buyers** and to **encourage more sustainable business practices** through curating beautiful, practical, consciously-produced products.

## Our Values

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** company values are statements about how you approach work; how you treat colleagues, customers and users; and what your company stands for.
{% endhint %}

### Be Compassionate

We treat everyone we encounter with compassion, seeing the humanity behind their problems and experiences.

### Be Mindful

We do not take advantage of our users' attention and adopt mindful working practices so that we can create safe spaces both in our working environment and in our products themselves.

### Research First

We challenge our own and others' assumptions through qualitative and quantitative research. Not sure about an idea? Test it.
